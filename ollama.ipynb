      "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the light in all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is because the smaller molecules have a greater tendency to absorb and scatter the shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the blue and violet light that reaches our eyes from the sky has been scattered in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance. The other colors of the visible spectrum, on the other hand, are reflected back to us from the surface of the Earth, which is why we see more red, orange, and yellow hues in the sky during sunrise and sunset.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, due to their higher frequency. However, even longer wavelengths, like red and orange, can still be scattered by the atmosphere, although less than blue and violet light.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths like blue and violet being scattered more than longer wavelengths.\n"
